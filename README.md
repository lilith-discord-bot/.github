## Hello there!

We are developers in the Diablo 4 community. We have no affiliation or association with Blizzard Entertainment at time of writing, but we wouldn't mind deeper convos of them.

We try to build tings around the Diablo 4 univese and we try to provide useful tool like the actual Lilith Discord bot.

### Contact Us

We have a public [Discord](https://discord.gg/Mv2yCrJK87) server.

There's a ko-fi running at https://ko-fi.com/lilithdiscordbot for people that want to contribute, we'll mainly use theses donations to keep hosting the bot and keep our infrastructure running.

### Joining?

Got a project that you think would be a good fit for maintenance here or a project idea you'd like to see happen? Talk to us about it on discord.
